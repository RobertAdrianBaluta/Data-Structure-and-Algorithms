# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
The goal of this assignment was to learn about data structures and their uses, together with understanding multiple algorithms and measuring their time duration for comparisons.
**This report details the implementation and performance evaluation of various algorithms on an array 
and a graph structure. The array, of different sizes, populated with random values, undergoes 
multiple sorting algorithms. The selected algorithms are timed measured. Furthermore, a Node
graph is implemented from a file and then traversed.
